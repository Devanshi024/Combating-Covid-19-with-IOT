Combating COVID-19 with IoT is a project that aims to address the requirements posed by the pandemic.

A pandemic-driven initiative enforces strict social distancing measures and prohibits public gatherings. To enhance safety, a smart attendance system utilizing RFID tags is being developed, logging attendance through a web portal. Additionally, the system monitors temperatures, issuing alerts to both administrators and individuals if readings exceed normal levels.

Our project includes two integrated devices for public safety: one counts people entering public spaces and alerts authorized personnel if a threshold is exceeded, accompanied by a buzzer. The second device detects fires and notifies the fire station if admin response is lacking, all managed through a single web interface.
